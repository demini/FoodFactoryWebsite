      <h3>Our History</h3>
      	<p>In 1905, Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was then known, was under British rule. Engineering – like many areas of enterprise - was the sole preserve of foreigners. But there were men with vision, courage and the determination to make their own mark. Mr. C. Jinasena was one of these. The beginnings were modest – servicing and repairing machinery used in tea and rubber manufacture. But Mr. Jinasena was a brilliant, yet practical engineer – and a member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, England, whose specialty was steam boilers and machinery, the main source of power in his time.</p>
        
        <p>By 1932, Jinasena was the only Ceylonese Company rated among the top five engineering companies in the island. Since then, innovation opened and widened many an avenue and successfully ventured into many areas outside the engineering sector. Today, the Jinasena Group, headquartered in Colombo in a modern 3,000 square foot complex, equipped with the latest data processing and communication technology, is a fifteen company conglomerate and is among Sri Lanka’s largest industrial and trading organizations.</p>
        
        <p>More importantly, the quality of the products in general – engineering in particular – is acknowledged internationally. The structure of the organization is geared to meet the most demanding deadlines on schedule and in the Jinasena tradition, continues to build cordial rapport with business partners the world over.</p>
