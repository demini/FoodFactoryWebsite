Hi..!!!

This is my project..
problem - it is boring to keep a private diary & write on it. Sometimes our 
special memories may forget to write on diary after coming back to home.

solution - develop an android diary book. Login will be done through a pin code. 
App will be able to show the calendar. When user click on a date the new interface 
will appear. This has the ability to upload pictures and videos, write paragraphs, 
add friends from social media and sync. So when we start to write a name a 
suggestion list of names with their image will display. Therefore the user can 
easily update the diary about she was with them. The dates which the user have 
updated with some memories will be highlighted in the calendar display.
